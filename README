Files Needed:
	1.	Poincare_Sections.m
	2.	librationPoints.m
	3.	JacobiPotential.m
	4.	jacobiConst.m
	5.	Velocity.m
	6.	Trajectory_Crossing.m
	7.	vectorField.m
	8.	Reverse_vectorField.m



Instructions For Poincare Sections:
	1.	Open “Poincare_Sections.m” 
	2.	Define your parameters in lines 9-18
	3.	Define initial conditions to input into Hamiltonian for energy level in line 66
	4.	Set parameters for the Poincare map computation in line 72
	⁃	‘k’ can be 100 for quick computations. Set to 300 for detailed sections
	⁃	‘l’ should be 1 if you want xdot=0. Otherwise, set l>1. This will make section more detailed but will make integrator much more sensitive to initial conditions. 
	⁃	‘iterates’ can be 300 for quick computations. Set to 1000 for detailed sections.
	5.	Set left and right endpoints to be computed in line 75. This should cover the coordinates to be investigated. 
	6.	(Optional) Set initial conditions for integrator in lines 128-129 and lines 139-141. NOTE: comment out line 139 if l>1
	7.	Run



Instructions For Orbits:
	1.	Open “OrbitPathfinder.m”
	2.	Define your parameters in lines 21-30
	3.	Define initial conditions to input into Hamiltonian for energy level in line 78
	4.	Set coordinates of the Poincare section you want to investigate in lines 83 and 84
	5.	Set number of iterates to run in line 88. Anywhere between 200-800 is good depending on how much detail you want.
	6.	Lines 94-96 are initial conditions that should match the ICs in “Poincare_Sections.m” 
	7.	(Optional) Change tilmestep in line 132
	8.	Run
